# Arcanya

This is stable-diffusion image2image generated nekomimi style arcaea song covers.

You can use it in:

- Your frontend (including and not limited to websites, applications, forms)
- Your bots (e.g. score layout design)
- Arcaea simulators, or chart viewer
- A copy of Arcaea
- Any non-commercial project

# Detail

Images are 512x512 pixels, and organized same as arcaea's origin structure. Naming pattern is: `[difficulty]_[id]-[cfg]-[denoise].png`. Dots are replaced with underslash.

For example, base cover with id=12, cfg=5, denoise=0.5 is named `base_12-5-0_5.png`.

There may be mutiple images per origin song cover.

Meant to add some nekomimi style to your bots or something.

Perhaps avoiding Lowiro's TOS issues.
